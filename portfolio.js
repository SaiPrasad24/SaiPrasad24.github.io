// You can use this JavaScript file to add any interactivity you want to the website.
// For example, you can use it to handle form submissions or add animations.

// Example of handling the form submission (requires updating the HTML form to have an ID):
const form = document.getElementById('contact-form');
form.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  // Here you can add code to handle the form submission, like sending the form data to a server or displaying a confirmation message.
});
